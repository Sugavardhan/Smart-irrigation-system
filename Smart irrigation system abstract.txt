# SMART-IRRIGATION-SYSTEM
This project can designed using Arduino Uno .It can automate irrigation system in agriculture land.
According to the field and plants both ph level, moisture of the soil will detected by
using ph sensor and moisture sensor.

If ph level is greater than 7(Base) and moisture level is less than 10. Fertilizer is mixed with water
automatically, starts to irrigate the plants.When it reaches the particular level, automatically the
motor will turn off.Using uv laser animals get detected and intimated through sound.
